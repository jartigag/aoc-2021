my solutions to Advent of Code 2021.
this year i'm learning typescript, so i forked this [aoc-ts-starter](https://github.com/bpiggin/advent-of-code-typescript-starter) repo.

if i get the time, i'll try to take a look at [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode) and post my favourites here. people is amazing.

> as last year, our group “[TLMn00bs](https://github.com/TLMn00bs)” keeps sharing our solutions in this [repository](https://github.com/TLMn00bs/advent-of-code).
